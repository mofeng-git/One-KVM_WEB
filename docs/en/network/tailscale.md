    - Avoid complex network configuration
    - Protect data with end-to-end encryption
    - Use across multiple platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android)

!!! tip "Tailscale device IP"
    - Tailscale typically assigns an IP like `100.x.y.z`
    - Use this IP to access your One-KVM from anywhere
